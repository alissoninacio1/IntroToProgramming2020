#After seeing this week content videos, I decided to use a funtion to write less lines of code
def menu_exercise ():
  print "Mexican Pizza - $6.00 " + "\n   Ingredients: Jalapeno pepper, onion, red hot pepper, beans, cheese, hot sauce, and crust"
  print "Ice Cream Pizza - $7.00" + "\n   Ingredients: Chocolate ice cream, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sparks, and crust "
  print "Pepperoni Pizza - $5.00 " + "\n    Ingredients: Pepperoni, cheese, oregano, mozzarella, sauce, and crust"
  print "Vegetarian Pizza - $6.00" + "\n    Ingredients: Broccoli, cheese, tomato, korn, potato, sauce, and crust"
  print "Brazilian Pizza - $ 10.00" + "\n   Ingredients: Roast beef, saveloy, chicken, cheese, sauce, and crust"
  print "Chicken Cheese Pizza - $4.00" + "\n    Ingredients: Cicken, cheddar cheese, oregano, and crust" 
    
#Now, I print only one function.
